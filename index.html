		<h1>Introduction: What is VR?</h1>
		</br>
		</br>
		<p>VR (virtual reality) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.
			Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience and instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds by simulating
			as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, and touch. </p>
