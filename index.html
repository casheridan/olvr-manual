		<p style="color:#ffffff;">VR (virtual reality) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.
			Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience.
			Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds by simulating
			as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, touch. </p>
