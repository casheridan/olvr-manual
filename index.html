		<h1>Introduction: What is VR?</h1>
		</br>
		</br>
		<p>VR (Virtual Reality) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.
			Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience and instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds by simulating
			as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, and touch. </p>

			<p>Virtual Reality is the new sensation conquering the world. With so many different experiences VR has something for every generation. Older generations get to explore new places without leaving the comfort of their homes, as well as strengthen their minds. VR has been proven to slow dementia, Alzheimer’s, and more. For younger generations, it is a good education tool since VR keeps students stimulated in a world where school is in competition with technological distractions (phones). And while every generation loves the games, VR is also being purchased by NFL teams around the nation to teach safer tackling techniques to prevent concussions. Get ready to open your eyes to many dimensions of fun.</p>
