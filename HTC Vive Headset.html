<h1>How To Set Up/Use the HTC Vive Headset</h1>
<p>This page will guide you through how to set up, adjust, and use your new HTC Vive VR headset and controllers.</p>
<h2>Equipment List</h2>
<p>This is what you will find when you open the box:</p>
<ul>
	<li>HTC Vive Headset (The headset is your window to the VR environment).</li>
  <li>Two HTC Vive Controllers (these are how you interact with ibjects in the virtual reality).</li>
  <li>Two HTC Vive Tracking Peripherals (how your movements in virtual reality are tracked).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parts of the HTC Vive Headset</h2>
<img src="Images/good_headset.jpg" alt="Front View" style="width:600px;height:300px;">
<ol>
  <li>Camera Lens</li>
  <li>Tracking Sensor</li>
  <li>Headset Button</li>
  <li>Status Light</li>
  <li>Lens Distance Knob</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step One</h2>
<img src="Images/headset_strap.png" alt="Headset Strap" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<ol>
	<li>Pull the headset down over your eyes</li>
	<li>Slide the straps around the back of your head, and adjust them so that the headset fits snugly and comfortably</li>
	<li>Make sure that the cables pass through the sleeve at the back of the headset, and are positioned straight down your back</li>
</ol>
<p>To change the distance between the lenses, rotate the IPD (Interpupillary distance) knob. As you adjust the IPD, you'll see information displayed in the headset that indicates the current
distance between the centers of the lenses.</p>

<p>To change the distance the lenses are from your face, pull out each distance knob that are located on both sides of the headset, then turn them clockwise to adjust how close or far away the lenses are from your face. Once you have set the proper distance, push each knob back in to lock them.</p>
<h2>Step Two</h2>

<p>Plug in your USB cable so you can connect your Vive to third party devices. You can do this by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Push open the compartment cover to access the connector slots on the headset</li>
	<li>Plug in the USB cable to its corresponding slot</li>
	<li>Connect the third-party device to the USB cable end</li>
	<li>Replace the compartment cover</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step Three</h2>
<p>Unplug the three in one cable (The 3-in-1 cable connects HDMI, USB and Power from the link box to the VIVE headset with all three cords coming together as one). To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<img src="Images/three_in_one_cable.png" alt="Cable" style="width:400px;height:200px;">
<ol>
	<li>Push open the compartment cover to access the connector slots on the headset</li>
	<li>Carefully pull the tab until the HDMI cable is unplugged</li>
	<li>Unplug the power cable and USB cable from the connector</li>
	<li>Replace the compartment cover</li>
<h2>Step Four</h2>
<p>Connect the headset to the computer using the link box
(the HTC Vive Link Box serves as a link between your Vive headset and computer to make the magic of virtual reality possible). To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<img src="Images/link_box_1.png" alt="Link Box" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<ol>
	<li>Connect the power adapter cable on its corresponding port on the link box, and then plug the opposite end into an electrical outlet to turn the link box on</li>
	<li>Insert the HDMI cable on the HDMI port on the link box, and then insert the opposite end on the HDMI port on your computer's graphic card</li>
	<li>Insert the USB cable on the USB port on the link box, and then insert the opposite end on your computer's USB port</li>
	<li>Connect the 3-in-1 headset (HDMI, USB, and power) cables on the side with matching orange trims on the link box</li>
</ol>
<p>To secure the link box in a permanent position, peel the covers from the mounting pad and firmly press one side of the adhesive surface on the bottom part of the link box, and then attach the link box on the area where you want it installed</p>

<h1>How To Set Up/Use the HTC Vive Controllers</h1>
<p>This page will teach you how to use your HTC Vive Controllers.</p>
<h2>HTC Vive Controllers</h2>
<p>The controllers are used to interact with objects in VR. There are several buttons on each controller:</p>
<img src="Images/better_controllers.jpg" alt="HTC Vive Controlers" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
<ol>
  <li>Menu button</li>
	<li>Trackpad</li>
	<li>System button</li>
	<li>Status light</li>
	<li>Micro-USB port</li>
	<li>Tracking sensor</li>
	<li>Trigger</li>
	<li>Grip button</li>
</ol>
<h2>How To Charge the Controllers</h2>
<p>You can check the battery level of the controllers when no apps are running, or when the System Dashboard is up. When the battery is low, the indicator will show a single red dot. Charge each controller using the provided power adapters and USB cables. When the controller is plugged in and fully charged, its status light shows green if the controller is on or white if the controller is off.</p>
<h2>How To Pair the Controllers With the Headset</h2>
<p>Once the controllers are turned on for the first time, they will automatically pair with the headset. The status light shows as blinking blue while the pairing is in progress. The status light turns solid green when the controllers are paired with the headset. To manually pair the controllers, launch the SteamVR app, tap Devices Pair Controller. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.</p>
<h2>How To Use the Lanyards</h2>
<p>The lanyards are used to keep the controller from flying form your hand while moving. While holding the controller, insert the lanyard's thread from the top to the bottom hole. Next, loop the lanyard through the thread, and then tug the lanyard to fasten it in place. Place the lanyard on your wrist, and then adjust the lock to tighten the lanyard comfortably around your wrist.</p>
