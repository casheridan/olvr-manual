<h1>How To Set Up/Use the HTC Vive Headset</h1>
<p>This page will guide you through how to set up, adjust, and use your new HTC Vive VR headset.</p>
<h2>Equipment List</h2>
<p>This is what you will find when you open the box:</p>
<ul>
	<li>HTC Vive Headset (The headset is your window to the VR environment.</li>
  <li>The headset has sensors that are tracked by the base stations.)</li>
	<li>Two HTC Vive Controllers</li>
	<li>Two HTC Vive Tracking Peripherals</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step One</h2>
<p>Once you have familiarized yourself with the pieces of equipment, go ahead and put on the HTC Vive headset (don't forget to remove the protective film first). To put the headset on properly, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Pull the headset down over your eyes</li>
	<li>Slide the straps around the back of your head, and adjust them so that the headset fits snugly and comfortably</li>
	<li>Make sure that the cables pass through the sleeve at the back of the headset, and are positioned straight down your back</li>
</ol>
<p>To change the distance between the lenses, rotate the IPD (Interpupillary distance) knob. As you adjust the IPD, you'll see information displayed in the headset that indicates the current
distance between the centers of the lenses.</p>

<p>To change the distance the lenses are from your face, pull out each distance knob that are located on both sides of the headset, then turn them clockwise to adjust how close or far away the lenses are from your face. Once you have set the proper distance, push each knob back in to lock them.</p>
<p>Plug in a USB cable to the headset so you can use a compatible third-party device with Vive. You can do this by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Push open the compartment cover to access the connector slots on the headset</li>
	<li>Plug in the USB cable to its corresponding slot</li>
	<li>Connect the third-party device to the USB cable end</li>
	<li>Replace the compartment cover</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step Three</h2>
<p>Unplug the three in one cable (The 3-in-1 cable connects HDMI, USB and Power from the link box to the VIVE headset with all three cords coming together as one). To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Push open the compartment cover to access the connector slots on the headset</li>
	<li>Carefully pull the tab until the HDMI cable is unplugged</li>
	<li>Unplug the power cable and USB cable from the connector</li>
	<li>Replace the compartment cover</li>
</ol>
<p>Connect the headset to the computer using the link box
(the HTC Vive Link Box serves as a link between your Vive headset and computer to make the magic of virtual reality possible). To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Connect the power adapter cable on its corresponding port on the link box, and then plug the opposite end into an electrical outlet to turn the link box on</li>
	<li>Insert the HDMI cable on the HDMI port on the link box, and then insert the opposite end on the HDMI port on your computer's graphic card</li>
	<li>Insert the USB cable on the USB port on the link box, and then insert the opposite end on your computer's USB port</li>
	<li>Connect the 3-in-1 headset (HDMI, USB, and power) cables on the side with matching orange trims on the link box</li>
</ol>
<p>To secure the link box in a permanent position, peel the covers from the mounting pad and firmly press one side of the adhesive surface on the bottom part of the link box, and then attach the link box on the area where you want it installed</p>
