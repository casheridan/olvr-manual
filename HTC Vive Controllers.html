<h1>How To Set Up/Use the HTC Vive Controllers</h1>
<p>This page will teach you how to use your HTC Vive Controllers.</p>
<h2>HTC Vive Controllers</h2>
<p>The controllers are used to interact with objects in VR. There are several buttons on each controller:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Menu button</li>
	<li>Trackpad</li>
	<li>System button</li>
	<li>Status light</li>
	<li>Micro-USB port</li>
	<li>Tracking sensor</li>
	<li>Trigger</li>
	<li>Grip button</li>
</ol>
<h2>How To Charge the Controllers</h2>
<p>You can check the battery level of the controllers when no apps are running, or when the System Dashboard is up. When the battery is low, the indicator will show a single red dot. Charge each controller using the provided power adapters and USB cables. When the controller is plugged in and fully charged, its status light shows green if the controller is on or white if the controller is off.</p>
<h2>How To Pair the Controllers With the Headset</h2>
<p>Once the controllers are turned on for the first time, they will automatically pair with the headset. The status light shows as blinking blue while the pairing is in progress. The status light turns solid green when the controllers are paired with the headset. To manually pair the controllers, launch the SteamVR app, tap Devices Pair Controller. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.</p>
<h2>How To Use the Lanyards</h2>
<p>The lanyards are used to keep the controller from flying form your hand while moving. While holding the controller, insert the lanyard's thread from the top to the bottom hole. Next, loop the lanyard through the thread, and then tug the lanyard to fasten it in place. Place the lanyard on your wrist, and then adjust the lock to tighten the lanyard comfortably around your wrist.</p>
